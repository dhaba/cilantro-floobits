    ModelBase is the abstract class which defines required methods for any data model that is passed between nodes.

    Models are essentially just a wrapper around the underlying data interchange format (Captain Proto or JSON), which
    provide convenient methods for manipulating, reading, and computing functions of the data. They can also provide
    an interface for executing RPC on the data between nodes.
